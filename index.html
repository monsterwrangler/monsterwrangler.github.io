<H2>Custom Icons for BostonPogoMap</H2>
<P>
BostonPogoMap.com is a great Pokémon Go map, but sadly, they were asked to remove the icons for the Pokémon. Fortunately you can get them back using a "bookmarklet" -- a bookmark that contains JavaScript to fix up the icons. The process is a little odd, so we'll go through it step by step.

<P>
To get started, go to this <a href="bookmarklet.html?#javascript:(function(){for(var i=1;i<=251;i++){localStorage.setItem('icon'+i,'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devsrc/pogo-sprites/master/sprites/clean/'+i+'.png');}window.location.reload();})();">bookmarklet page</a> (the rest of the instructions are on that page).
